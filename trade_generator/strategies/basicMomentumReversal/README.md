# Moving Average Cross Strategy #1

## Overview

When a momentum switches from decreasing to increasing or vice versa, make a trade.  Close when it reverses back.  

## Parameters

As input, this momentum takes the following: 

 - Momemtum

## Expansion

As this strategy basically is always in a trade due to the fact that moving averaes are either going up or down all the time, it will be best to come up with some other factor to enter trades than only momentum.  

It will also be necessary to determine whether a momentum is flat or actually showing signs of heading somewhere.

- Maybe split trade closure into two parts: one when a smaller period momentum  reverses and one when the original, high-period momentum reverses.
