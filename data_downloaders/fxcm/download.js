FXCM Historical Data Downloader

Using the FXCM Broker API, this utility pulls down historical ticks from their trade servers
in conjunction with the tick_recorder java application which serves as the link to their API.

Requests are made to that application over redis which are then procesed, send to the FXCM servers,
and sent back as a redis reply.
