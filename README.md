He's back again with a new and improved vision for the perfect trading bot.  It's going to be amazing this time, trust me.  

This time it's going back to nodejs for the core language and using mongodb for the database.  No fucking around with redis (except maybe for message passing)and no bullshit with creating fake data types to encapsulate what should be tablular data.

We're focusing on a core "brain" module that relies on all the other modules to input data, calculations, and streaming ticks to it both live and on-demand.  Calculations should be kept as on-demand as possible except for those that will be stored for archival purposes.  

This is a Spring bot; not some fucky winter bullshit.  This is the one that's going to do it.  Either this or one of its children.  I really, honestly belive.
